Contract Address: 0x0c4bf241c8934ec7401ee9f833de73de4296bd61
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0c4bf241c8934ec7401ee9f833de73de4296bd61

Note: I used Ropsten, cause Rinkeby is not working and i cant deploy contracts there and is also really difficult from faucets to get ethers

Libraries Used:
- PetSHop Truffle Box: Latest version
    I used this truffle box as template, because the prokject 6 version templated recomended uses old versions of web3 and doesnt work properly.
- Truffle HD Wallet Provider: "@truffle/hdwallet-provider": "^1.0.41-1"
    I used this library to connect with infura.
- Lite-Server: ^2.3.0
    This library is used to host all the files specified in bs-config in my site ... is good to specify, for example, where are the contracts builded.

IPFS implementation: I didnt implement optional infura to storing images of Items this time. 

Program Version Numbers:
- npm 8.8.0
- node 16.14.0
- Truffle v5.5.22 (core: 5.5.22)
- Ganache v7.3.2
- Solidity - 0.8.1 (solc-js)
- Web3.js v1.7.4

Other Notes:
In the project folder there are also two folders for UML and other test evidences:

- UML: There is a UML folder with 4 UML diagrams inside (html format): Activity, Sequence, State & Class(Data Model)

- Test Evidences: There are 4 screenshots that shows all test process that i have made in roptsten network.
